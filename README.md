## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Total Course:** ~8-12 hours (when all modules complete)

**Current Modules:**

- Module 1: 40-55 minutes (HTML structure + Git setup)
- Module 2: 60-75 minutes (CSS fundamentals)
- Module 3: 75-90 minutes (Home page styling)

**Each module is designed to:**

- Be completed in one focused session
- Provide immediate visual results
- Build on previous module's knowledge
- Include breaks for testing and verification

## 🎓 Learning Approach

This course follows a **foundation-first, incremental approach**:

### 1. HTML First, Styling Later

Module 1 focuses purely on semantic HTML structure. You'll see your content work even without CSS, proving the importance of solid HTML.

### 2. Incremental CSS Implementation

Module 2 breaks CSS into 7 small steps with testing after each. You'll see your site transform progressively, never feeling overwhelmed.

### 3. Visual Feedback Loop

Every step includes a verification section - you immediately see what you've built. This keeps you motivated and helps catch errors early.

### 4. Professional Practices

Git workflow is integrated from Module 1. You'll use feature branches, meaningful commits, and GitHub from the start - just like professional developers.

### 5. Modern Techniques

Learn CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties - the tools professionals use today, not outdated float-based layouts.

## 💡 Why Learn Pure HTML/CSS?

### Before Frameworks, Understand the Platform

Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) abstract away HTML/CSS fundamentals. By mastering pure HTML/CSS first, you'll:

- **Understand what frameworks do** - Know what's happening under the hood
- **Debug better** - Recognize CSS issues regardless of framework
- **Write better code** - Make informed decisions about when to use frameworks
- **Build faster** - Sometimes pure HTML/CSS is the best tool
- **Interview better** - Strong fundamentals impress employers

### Real-World Applications

Pure HTML/CSS skills are valuable for:

- Landing pages and marketing sites
- Email templates
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio websites
- Prototypes and mockups
- Contributing to open-source projects
