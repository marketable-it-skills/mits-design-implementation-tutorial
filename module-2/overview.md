# Module 2: CSS Fundamentals - Base & Layout

## Overview

In Module 1, you built a complete 4-page website with semantic HTML structure. Your site works perfectly - all the content is there, all the links work - but it looks completely unstyled with browser default styling (black text on white background).

In this module, you'll transform your plain HTML into a **professionally styled dark-themed website** by implementing two CSS files: `base.css` and `layout.css`. You'll see a dramatic visual transformation as you add styles incrementally, learning fundamental CSS concepts along the way.

## What are Base & Layout CSS?

### base.css - Foundation Styles

`base.css` contains the **foundational styles** that apply across your entire website:

- CSS reset (consistent starting point)
- CSS custom properties (your design system variables)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, colors for text elements)
- Base element styles (links, lists, paragraphs)

Think of it as setting up your "design system" - the rules that make your site cohesive.

### layout.css - Structural Layout

`layout.css` contains styles for **structural components** that appear on every page:

- Container (centers and constrains content width)
- Header (navigation bar at the top)
- Footer (information at the bottom)
- Main content spacing
- Section organization

Think of it as the "skeleton" that holds your content together.

## What You'll Learn

- **CSS Reset** - Why and how to reset browser defaults
- **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** - Modern way to manage design tokens
- **Box Model** - How CSS calculates element dimensions
- **Typography Hierarchy** - Creating visual hierarchy with font sizes and weights
- **Flexbox** - 1-dimensional layout for header and navigation
- **CSS Grid** - 2-dimensional layout for footer columns
- **Sticky Positioning** - Making the header stick to the top
- **Container Pattern** - Centering and constraining content width

## Why This Matters

### Foundation Before Details

By implementing base and layout CSS first, you establish a solid foundation. This approach:

- Creates consistency across all pages
- Makes adding page-specific styles easier later
- Teaches you the most impactful CSS first
- Follows professional development workflow

### Visual Transformation

This module provides the most dramatic visual change in the entire course. You'll go from completely unstyled HTML to a professional-looking dark-themed website, which is incredibly motivating!

### Modern CSS Practices

You'll learn CSS custom properties (variables), Flexbox, and Grid - the modern tools that professional developers use every day, not outdated techniques like floats or tables.

## PRD Connection

This module implements the foundational design from the PRD:

> **Design Requirements → MITS Platform Branding**
>
> - Dark theme color scheme (slate backgrounds, cyan accents)
> - Professional typography with clear hierarchy
> - Consistent spacing and layout

> **Layout & Spacing**
>
> - Container max-width: 1200px
> - Consistent spacing scale
> - Header with sticky positioning
> - Footer with organized sections

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- ✅ Completed Module 1 (HTML structure with empty CSS files)
- ✅ Basic understanding of CSS selectors (class, element, id)
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- ✅ Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- ✅ Browser DevTools knowledge (basic - we'll teach you more)

## Time Estimate

⏱️ **60-75 minutes**

This module takes longer than Module 1 because you're learning several CSS concepts, but we break it down into small, manageable steps with testing after each step.

## Module Structure

This module uses an **incremental approach** - you'll alternate between `base.css` and `layout.css`, testing after each step:

1. **Task 1**: CSS Reset & Variables (base.css) - Set up foundation
2. **Task 2**: Base Typography (base.css) - Style text elements
3. **Task 3**: Container Class (layout.css) - Center content
4. **Task 4**: Header Structure (layout.css) - Build navigation bar
5. **Task 5**: Navigation Styling (layout.css) - Polish the nav menu
6. **Task 6**: Main Content & Sections (layout.css) - Add spacing
7. **Task 7**: Footer Structure (layout.css) - Organize footer with Grid
8. **Task 8**: Version Control with Git - Commit and push your work

Each task includes:

- Clear instructions
- Complete code snippets
- Explanation of what the code does
- **Verification step** - See your changes immediately!

## Expected Result

By the end of this module, your website will have:

### Visual Transformation

- ✅ **Dark theme** - Professional slate background with cyan accents
- ✅ **Beautiful typography** - Clear hierarchy, readable text
- ✅ **Styled header** - Sticky navigation bar with hover effects
- ✅ **Organized footer** - 3-column grid layout
- ✅ **Proper spacing** - Content breathes, not cramped
- ✅ **Centered layout** - 1200px max-width, centered on screen

### Skills Gained

- ✅ Understand CSS reset and box model
- ✅ Use CSS custom properties for theming
- ✅ Apply typography hierarchy
- ✅ Build layouts with Flexbox and Grid
- ✅ Implement sticky positioning
- ✅ Follow professional CSS organization
- ✅ Continue Git workflow with feature branches

### What's NOT in This Module

- ❌ Button styles (comes in Module 3 with hero section)
- ❌ Page-specific styles (comes in Module 3)
- ❌ Responsive design (comes in Module 7)
- ❌ Advanced animations (comes in later modules)

## Teaching Approach

This module follows an **incremental, test-as-you-go approach**:

1. **Small steps** - Each step takes 5-10 minutes
2. **Immediate feedback** - Test after every step
3. **Progressive understanding** - Each step builds on the previous
4. **Alternating files** - Switch between base.css and layout.css
5. **Clear explanations** - Understand the "why" behind each style

This approach ensures you:

- ✅ Never feel overwhelmed
- ✅ Always see progress
- ✅ Can debug easily if something goes wrong
- ✅ Build understanding step-by-step
